# gzip-util

Some utility functions for working with gzip in Clojure. Uses
java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream and GZIPOutputStream under the hood.

## Usage

Current leiningen dependency:

```clojure
[piotr-yuxuan/gzip-util "0.1.0"]
```

Then two methods are available:

```clojure
;; gzip a string:
(str->gzipped-bytes "string to compress")

;; un-gzip a java.io.InputStream, returning a UTF-8 encoded string:
(gzipped-input-stream->str input-stream "UTF-8")

```
